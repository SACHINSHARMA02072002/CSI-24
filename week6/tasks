1. Configure Self-hosted Integration Runtime (SHIR)
Install and Configure SHIR:

Download the SHIR installer from the Azure portal.
Install it on your local server following the installation wizard.
Register the SHIR in Azure Data Factory by using the key provided in the ADF portal.
Create a Linked Service for SHIR:

In the ADF portal, go to Manage -> Linked services.
Click New, select your data store (e.g., SQL Server), and configure it to use the SHIR.
2. Configure FTP/SFTP Server and Create ADF Pipeline for Data Extraction
Set Up FTP/SFTP Linked Service:

Go to Manage -> Linked services.
Click New, select FTP or SFTP, and enter the connection details (server, port, user, password, etc.).
Create a Pipeline to Extract Data from FTP/SFTP:

Go to Author -> Pipelines -> New pipeline.
Add a Copy Data activity to the pipeline.
Configure the Source to use the FTP/SFTP linked service.
Configure the Sink to use your target Azure database linked service.
3. Create Incremental Load Pipeline and Automate on a Daily Basis
Create Incremental Load Pipeline:

Go to Author -> Pipelines -> New pipeline.
Add activities to handle incremental data loading (e.g., a Lookup activity to get the last loaded timestamp, followed by a Copy Data activity).
Use parameters to dynamically set the time range for the incremental load.
Set Up Daily Trigger:

Go to Manage -> Triggers.
Create a new trigger and set it to Scheduled.
Configure the trigger to run daily at your desired time.
Attach the trigger to your incremental load pipeline.
4. Automate Pipeline to Trigger Every Last Saturday of the Month
Create Pipeline for Monthly Task:

Go to Author -> Pipelines -> New pipeline.
Add the activities required for your monthly task.
Set Up Monthly Trigger:

Go to Manage -> Triggers.
Create a new trigger and set it to Scheduled.
Use a cron expression to schedule the trigger for the last Saturday of each month (e.g., 0 0 0 ? * 7L).
Attach the trigger to your monthly pipeline.
5. Retrieving Data and Handling Errors
If you encounter an error like "Retrieving data. Wait a few seconds and try to cut or copy again," it may be related to network latency or a temporary issue with the data store. Ensure your connection strings and credentials are correct, and that there are no network issues between ADF and your data stores.

Summary of Steps:
Install and configure Self-hosted Integration Runtime.
Set up FTP/SFTP linked services.
Create pipelines for data extraction.
Set up incremental load and daily triggers.
Set up monthly triggers for specific tasks.
